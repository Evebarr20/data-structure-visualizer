        <h2 class="About Us">About Us</h2>
        <p> We are a group of four students in our senior year at Eastern Washington University. This website is our Senior project.
            We chose to create a website that allows users to visualize data structures. You can view the basic code of the structures and maybe
            a few methods sprinkled in to get the idea about how the data strutures as manipulated. 
            There are quite a few number of our peers(and some of us), we noticed who struggle with the visualization of the concepts of how a datastructure works.
            And so we thought a need for a more visual based learning tool was unfullfilled. If that is you as well then this is the place for you, welcome!
            We hope you enjoy our website and find it useful.
